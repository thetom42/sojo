I want to implement a system that uses AI to publish as an author on social journalism platforms like Medium, Substack etc. I want it to be an agentic system where a team of AI agents with dedicated skills like:

- hot topic scout
- idea generator
- researcher
- draft writer
- quality checker
- final version writer
- publisher should join together to produce articles, journals or even small notes.

Please do the following:

- Write a proposal making detailed suggestions on how such a system could look like.
- Write a complete feature list for such a system.
- Find more useful team roles and add it to the list of roles mentioned above.
- Discuss the benefits of such a system and evaluate its usefulness.
- Make some arguments about the feasibility of such a system.
- Discuss the legal issues that such a system might face.
